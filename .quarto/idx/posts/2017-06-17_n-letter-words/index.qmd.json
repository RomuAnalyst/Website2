I find it useful in a wide variety of contexts and thought other might too. To kick off my new blog, here's a post about it.\n\nThe function, `n_letter_words`, came about because I wanted to be able to generate row and column names for a large matrix - didn't matter what they were, as long as they were unique. Since I was in the habit of using the built-in `LETTERS` vector to do this for small matrices, I naturally thought of using combinations of letters to do this in a larger case. In figuring out how to do this, as is so often the case, it was [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11388359/unique-combination-of-all-elements-from-two-or-more-vectors) to the rescue. There, I learnt about `expand.grid` and could then use some tidyverse tools to get the vector I was after:\n\n```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nout <- expand.grid(LETTERS, LETTERS) %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  unite(word, 1:2, sep = \"\") %>%\n  pull()\nc(head(out), tail(out))\n```\n\nSorted! At least I thought so, until, a couple of months later, when I wanted to generate names for a 1000\\*1000 matrix, and realised both that I'd forgotten the `expand.grid` trick, and once I'd re-found the stackoverflow post, that it didn't give me enough words. That was enough to make it worth writing a function, taking `n` as an argument, that gives all 'words' of length $n$. \n\nWriting functions always makes me think of what other arguments might be useful. What if we want something between the 676 two-letter words and 17,576 three-letter words (or the 456,976 four-letter words, etc)? Hence the argument `num_letters`, which can be set between 1 and 26, and results in a total of `num_letters`$^n$ words. By default, the function returns a `tibble`, but setting `as_vector = TRUE` does what you'd expect. And I threw in a `case` argument too.\n\nNow that I had my function, what to do with it? I remembered articles I'd read about the usefulness of [making](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) and [sharing]((https://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/)) a personal package. Now seemed like the time to do that myself. \n\nSo, [here](https://github.com/EllaKaye/EMK) is my personal package, `EMK`. If you think that `n_letter_words` might be of use to you, then feel free to install!\n\n```{r message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}\ndevtools::install_github(\"EllaKaye/EMK\")\n```\n\nSome examples of `n_letter_words`:\n\n```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\nlibrary(EMK)\n\nn_letter_words(2)\n\nsome_three_letter_words <- n_letter_words(\n  n = 3, \n  num_letters = 10, \n  case = \"lower\", \n  as_vector = TRUE\n)\n\nc(head(some_three_letter_words), tail(some_three_letter_words))\n\nlength(some_three_letter_words)\n```\n\nFor now, my personal package has only this one function, but watch this space! No doubt I'll be adding more that I find useful. Perhaps, you'll find them useful too.\n\nIncidentally, none of the above would have happened if I'd just thought, for my test matrix `A`, to set `dimnames(A) <- list(1:nrow(A), 1:ncol(A))`!\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n```{r appendix}\n#| echo: false\n\nsource(\"../../R/appendix.R\")\ninsert_appendix(\n  repo_spec = \"EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk\", \n  name = long_slug\n)\n```\n\n#### Session info {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Toggle</summary>\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nlibrary(sessioninfo)\n# save the session info as an object\npkg_session <- session_info(pkgs = \"attached\")\n\n# get the quarto version\nquarto_version <- system(\"quarto --version\", intern = TRUE)\n\n# inject the quarto info\npkg_session$platform$quarto <- paste(\n  system(\"quarto --version\", intern = TRUE), \n  \"@\", \n  quarto::quarto_path()\n  )\n\n# print it out\npkg_session\n```\n\n</details>\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: 'hide'\n\nlong_slug <- \"2017-06-17_n-letter-words\"\n\n# NOTE: after finishing post, run renv::snapshot() and copy the renv.lock file \n# from the project root into the post directory\nrenv::use(lockfile = \"renv.lock\")\n```\n\n\nThere's a little R function that I wrote and packaged up to generate a vector or data frame of words of a given length.
